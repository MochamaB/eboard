# Module 10: Notifications

**Purpose**: Keep users informed about meetings and system activities

## What We Need:

### 1. Email Notifications (Board-Tagged)
- Meeting invitation (with board name: "Main Board Meeting" vs "KETEPA Board Meeting")
- Meeting reminder (24 hours before, 1 hour before) with board identification
- Meeting started notification
- New document uploaded (specify which board)
- Agenda published (specify which board)
- Vote opened (specify which board)
- Action item assigned (specify from which board/meeting)
- Minutes published (specify which board)
- Meeting cancelled or rescheduled (specify which board)
- All notifications clearly indicate which board they relate to

### 2. In-App Notifications
- Notification bell icon showing unread count
- Dropdown list of recent notifications
- Click notification to go to related item
- Mark as read/unread
- Clear all notifications

### 3. SMS Notifications (Optional)
- Critical reminders only (meeting starting in 30 minutes)
- Emergency meeting alerts
- User can opt-in or opt-out of SMS

### 4. Notification Preferences
- Users can choose which notifications to receive
- Choose delivery method (email, in-app, SMS)
- Set quiet hours (e.g., no notifications between 10 PM - 7 AM)
- Digest mode (daily summary instead of real-time)
