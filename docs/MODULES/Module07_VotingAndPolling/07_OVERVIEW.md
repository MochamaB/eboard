# Module 7: Voting and Polling

**Purpose**: Conduct formal votes and informal polls during meetings with board-specific eligibility

## What We Need:

### 1. Create Vote (Board-Specific)
- Chairman creates vote linked to agenda item for their board's meeting
- Enter motion or resolution text
- Choose vote type:
  - Yes/No/Abstain
  - Multiple choice (A, B, C, D options)
  - Open ballot (everyone sees who voted what)
  - Secret ballot (anonymous votes)
- Set quorum requirement based on board's rules (e.g., "10 members must vote")
- Set passing threshold based on board's rules (e.g., "50% Yes votes to pass", "66% Yes votes", "100% unanimous")
- Different boards can have different voting thresholds

### 2. Cast Vote (Board Eligibility Check)
- Only members of that specific board can vote
- System verifies user's role on the board (Observers cannot vote, Members can vote)
- Board members see vote notification in meeting
- Clear voting interface with large buttons
- Must confirm vote before submitting
- Cannot change vote after submission (unless Chairman reopens vote)
- Option to abstain from voting
- Vote eligibility based on role on THAT board (user might be Observer on one board but Member on another)

### 3. Real-Time Vote Results
- See vote count updating in real-time
- Quorum status indicator (e.g., "8 of 10 required members voted")
- Show result: Passed or Failed
- For open ballots, show who voted what
- For secret ballots, show only totals

### 4. Vote History
- Record all votes with timestamps
- Who voted what and when
- Final result and whether quorum was met
- Export vote results to PDF
- Votes automatically recorded in meeting minutes

### 5. Informal Polls
- Quick polls for non-binding decisions
- Example: "What time works best for next meeting?"
- Real-time response collection
- Anonymous responses
- Display results as chart (bar graph, pie chart)

### 6. Proxy Voting (Optional for future phase)
- Board member can assign proxy to another member
- Proxy valid for specific meeting or date range
- Proxy vote recorded separately
- Audit trail for all proxy assignments
