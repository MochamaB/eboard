# Module 8: Meeting Minutes

**Purpose**: Record, approve, and publish official meeting minutes

## What We Need:

### 1. Minutes Creation
- Secretary takes minutes during or after meeting
- Rich text editor for formatting (bold, italic, lists, headings)
- Auto-populate with:
  - Meeting title, date, time
  - List of attendees (from attendance tracking)
  - Agenda structure
  - Vote results
- Auto-save draft every 30 seconds (prevent data loss)

### 2. Minutes Template
- Standard minutes format:
  - Meeting details (date, time, location/virtual)
  - Attendance and apologies
  - Approval of previous minutes
  - Matters arising
  - Agenda items discussed
  - Decisions and resolutions
  - Action items
  - Next meeting date
  - Adjournment time
- Different templates for different meeting types

### 3. Action Items from Minutes
- Create action items while writing minutes
- Action item includes:
  - Description of task
  - Assigned to (board member)
  - Due date
  - Priority (Low, Medium, High)
  - Status (Open, In Progress, Completed)
- Action items tracked separately and sent as reminders

### 4. Minutes Approval Workflow
- Secretary submits draft minutes for review
- Board members can comment or suggest edits
- Chairman reviews and provides final approval
- After approval, minutes are locked (read-only)
- Approval recorded with date and approver name

### 5. Publish Minutes
- Approved minutes distributed to all participants via email
- Generate official PDF version with digital signature (optional)
- Minutes added to meeting archive
- Minutes available for future reference

### 6. Minutes Search and Archive
- Search all past minutes by keyword, date, or topic
- Filter by meeting type or date range
- Download minutes as PDF
- Link to related documents and recordings
