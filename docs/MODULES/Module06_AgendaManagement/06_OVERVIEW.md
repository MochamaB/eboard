# Module 6: Agenda Management

**Purpose**: Create, organize, and execute meeting agendas

## What We Need:

### 1. Agenda Builder
- Secretary creates agenda for each meeting
- Add agenda items with title and description
- Set time allocation for each item (e.g., 15 minutes)
- Drag and drop to reorder items
- Agenda numbering automatic (1, 2, 3, 2.1, 2.2, etc.)

### 2. Agenda Item Types
- Discussion Item - topic for discussion only
- Decision Item - requires vote or resolution
- Information Item - report or update (no discussion)
- Committee Report - report from committee
- Associate time with each item type

### 3. Agenda Templates
- Create reusable agenda templates
- Example: Standard monthly board meeting template with recurring items (approval of previous minutes, financial report, CEO update, etc.)
- Apply template when creating new meeting agenda

### 4. Link Documents to Agenda Items
- Attach supporting documents to specific agenda items
- Example: Attach financial report PDF to "Financial Report" agenda item
- Documents appear when that agenda item is being discussed

### 5. Publish Agenda
- Secretary publishes agenda to all participants
- Generate PDF version of agenda
- Send notification email when agenda is published
- Lock agenda after publishing (requires republish to make changes)

### 6. Agenda Execution During Meeting
- Display current agenda item prominently during meeting
- Chairman can mark item as "in progress"
- Timer counts down time allocated for each item
- Mark item as complete, skipped, or postponed
- Add unplanned items during meeting (ad-hoc items)
- Track actual time spent on each item vs. allocated time
